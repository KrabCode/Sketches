# Sketches
This project contains my newest Processing sketches built using my custom GUI built on top of Processing.

The finished animations can be found on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/krabcode/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Simplyfire).

# How to run it
- Clone the project
- Open it in your favorite Java IDE, I recommend IntelliJ IDEA
- Download and set up Java 1.8
- Download and include the [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) library version 3.5.3
- Mark the src folder as source root
- Open any class from the src folder that contains a main method and run it like a standalone java program (CTRL+SHIFT+F10 in IDEA)

# GUI

All of these sketches use a GUI I built on top of Processing along with a number of other utility functions.
